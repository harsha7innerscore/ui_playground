<LoginMicrofrontendSpec>
  <Overview>
    This specification defines the requirements for building a fully functional, 
    production-ready Login Page microfrontend. The project is frontend-only, 
    developed in TypeScript, following the MVP (Model-View-Presenter) pattern. 
    Business logic will reside in Presenter (.ts files), and the View layer will 
    be implemented in .tsx files. The module will function as a microfrontend 
    with environment-based API gateway support.

    <Language>TypeScript</Language>
    <Microfrontend>Yes</Microfrontend>
    <ViewLayer>TSX (React)</ViewLayer>
    <BusinessLogicLayer>Presenter (.ts)</BusinessLogicLayer>
    <APIIntegration>
      <Gateway>Environment-based gateway (dev, staging, prod)</Gateway>
      <HttpFile>Central Http file for API calls with state management</HttpFile>
    </APIIntegration>
  </Architecture>

  <SecurityConsiderations>
    <TokenStorage>
      Define secure storage for JWT/refresh tokens. Prefer httpOnly cookies, 
      or if using local/session storage, enforce encryption and expiry checks.
    </TokenStorage>
    <CSRFProtection>
      Include CSRF tokens if cookies are used. All API requests must be protected 
      against replay or forgery attacks.
    </CSRFProtection>
    <PasswordHandling>
      Ensure no plain credentials are logged or cached. 
      API communication must always use HTTPS.
    </PasswordHandling>
  </SecurityConsiderations>

  <MicrofrontendIntegrationContract>
    <ExposedModule>
      The login module must be packaged for microfrontend consumption (e.g., Module Federation).
    </ExposedModule>
    <Communication>
      Provide clear output events (onLoginSuccess, onLogout) to notify the shell/container.
    </Communication>
    <Branding>
      Allow host applications to pass configuration for logo, theme colors, and brand assets.
    </Branding>
  </MicrofrontendIntegrationContract>

  <UIUXRequirements>
    <States>
      Must handle Idle, Loading, Success, and Error states. Inputs should be disabled 
      during API calls.
    </States>
    <ErrorHandling>
      Provide inline validation errors (e.g., invalid email format) and 
      API error feedback (e.g., wrong password).
    </ErrorHandling>
    <Accessibility>
      Implement ARIA labels, focus management for error states, and 
      ensure full screen-reader compatibility.
    </Accessibility>
    <ResponsiveDesign>
      Layout must be responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints.
    </ResponsiveDesign>
    <ThemeSupport>
      The login page must support both Light Mode and Dark Mode, 
      with theme switching either automatic (based on system preference) 
      or configurable by the host microfrontend shell.
    </ThemeSupport>
  </UIUXRequirements>

  <TestingStrategy>
    <UnitTests>
      Use Jest for testing presenter logic (form validation, token parsing, etc.).
    </UnitTests>
    <IntegrationTests>
      Test Http file API state machine (success, error, refresh handling).
    </IntegrationTests>
    <EndToEndTests>
      Use Cypress or Playwright to simulate full login flows, 
      including error and success scenarios.
